# Tigera Presentation (Service Mesh & Observability)

## Topic

Service Mesh and Observability


## Title

Service Mesh, Observability and Beyond


## Session Type

30-40 minutes pre-recorded presentation


## Description

A service mesh is a tool for adding observability, security, and reliability features to applications by inserting these features at the platform layer rather than the application layer. In this talk we'll go through what customers think about Service Mesh, how they use it, key challenges and need for simplification


## Abstract

Although at itâ€™s core "Service Mesh" is defined as a tool for adding observability, security, and reliability features to applications, it does not prove to be realization yet. Customers stand segregated to understand and benefit from the complete feature set vs. matured customers trying to deal with multifold operational challenges. In this talk we will go through:

* capabilities of Service Mesh
* components of Service Mesh
* open and closed Mesh
* customer challenges with Service Mesh
* can we simplify?

## Job titles/functions and/or experience

Application developers, platform providers, operators


## Audience Level

Intermediate


## Conceptual or how-to?

Conceptual


## Any prerequisite knowledge required?

General understanding of Service Mesh, Envoy proxy, Observability, Control Plane vs Data Plane, and Kubernetes is preferred, but not must.


## Audience Takeaways

* Service Mesh not only provides Observability
* Customer position, confusion, and challenges
* Simplification and ease of use
