About
Iâ€™m a Senior Developer Advocate at AWS, focused on containers, container orchestration and Kubernetes. Iâ€™m currently focusing on CNI, networking, service meshes, and observability. 

I am currently learning challenges in onboarding, managing, and operationalizing service meshes at scale.

I'm looking to collaborate on defining next gen cloud computing at edge, edge containers, kubernetes at edge, network functions, IoT, and SD-WAN. 

I truly enjoy solving customers challenges, working on proof-of-concepts, building distributed and scalable solutions, and problem solving. I am always in for any game day.
